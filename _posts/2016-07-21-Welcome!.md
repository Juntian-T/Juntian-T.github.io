Welcome!

Recently I realized the importance of keeping a record of what I learnt every day, especially in this particular period of time in my life – graduated from college. There’s been a lot of thoughts going through my mind lately, so much that I even felt a bit overwhelmed. Thus, I decided to write blogs, to digitize those thoughts – not only to help myself at the moment to keep track of my time and life, but also serve as a reference to the future myself.

My blogs will probably cover a lot of different categories, and they could be written in either English or Chinese. If you are reading this, hope my blogs could be helpful to you in some way. Thank you.

欢迎！

最近我越发意识到记录自己学习与生活的重要性，特别是在现在这个特殊的阶段 ——大学毕业。这一段时间内脑子里总是有各种各样的想法，多到我甚至感到有些压抑。因此，我决定开始写博客，记录下这些想法——不仅为了帮助现在的自己记录生活，也是让未来的自己有个参考。

我的博客会涵盖许多方面的内容，我会用中文或是英文去写下他们。如果你正在读我的博客，希望它能对你有一点点的帮助。谢谢。
